        "#The Beauty of Transformer\n",
        "###Unlike RNN and LSTM, which processes are done step-by-step and inherently obey the order, transformer processes the tokens in a sequence simultaneously->parallel computing\n",
        "\n",
        "###But transformers are different. They're like super-fast readers who can look at all the words in a sentence at once. This makes them work really quickly and understand connections between words that are far apart from each other. However, there's a catch – transformers don't naturally know the order of words in a sentence. They can mix things up because they read everything at the same time.\n",
        "\n",
        "###So, to fix this, we use something called \"positional encoding.\" It's like adding a special code to each word in the sentence to tell the transformer where it belongs in the sequence. This way, the transformer can read everything at once and still understand the order of words. Positional encoding is like giving each word a unique address, so the transformer doesn't get things mixed up when it's reading.\n",
        "\n",
        "###One common way to make these codes is by using wavy patterns, like waves in the ocean. Each wave pattern is different for each position in the sentence, so the model can tell them apart.\n",
        "\n",
        "###So, think of positional encodings as the model's way of figuring out the order of words in a sentence by adding special patterns to the words. It's like giving the model a map to follow in the sea of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "###One might wonder, why not just append or add the token's position as an integer to the embedding? Imagine you have a list of numbers, like [1, 2, 3, 4], and you want to add a special number to each of them. But you have to be careful with this special number because if it's too big, it might mess up the other numbers in your list.\n",
        "\n",
        "###So, instead of adding a big number directly, you decide to be smart about it. You create a set of rules or patterns (kind of like a secret code) that you can add to each number. These rules won't mess up the original numbers because they're designed to be small and gentle.\n",
        "\n",
        "###In the end, you get something like [1+pattern1, 2+pattern2, 3+pattern3, 4+pattern4]. Now, your original numbers are still there, but you've added a bit of extra information to each of them in a safe and controlled way.\n",

        "When we train a model, like this special transformer-based one, we follow some important rules and techniques that are similar to what we do with other computer models.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Training in Batches**: We don't teach the model one example at a time. Instead, we group several examples together into batches. This is like teaching a bunch of students in a class rather than one student at a time. It makes the learning process faster and helps the model understand things better.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Early Stopping**: Sometimes, when the model learns too much, it starts memorizing things instead of understanding them. So, we use a trick called \"early stopping.\" We regularly check how well the model is doing on a separate set of data (we call it a validation set). If the model stops improving or gets too good at remembering the training data, we stop training. It's like saying, \"You've learned enough.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Validation Set**: This is like a practice test for the model. We use it to see how well the model is doing on data it has never seen before. It's important to make sure the model doesn't just learn to repeat the training data but can also handle new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In simple terms, while transformer models have some fancy tricks, the basic rules for training them are similar to other models. We use batches for efficient learning, stop training when the model is doing well, and check its performance on new data to make sure it's a smart learner."
